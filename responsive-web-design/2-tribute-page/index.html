                Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls.
                Where words come out from the depth of truth,
                where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection.
                Where the clear stream of reason has not lost it's way
                into the dreary desert sand of dead habit.
                Where the mind is led forward by thee
                into ever widening thought and action.
