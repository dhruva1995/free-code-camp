                <p>Once upon a time, the world of computer programming was a mysterious and exclusive place. Only a
                    select handful of people were considered computer programmers with cutting-edge coding skills.
                    Today, many IT jobs require a solid grasp of the top programming languages, and yes, we mean more
                    than one</p>
                <p>If your plans to advance your career or change careers completely requires you to master a
                    programming language, you might wonder which one to learn. After all, it will take time and money to
                    learn the language, so you want to make the right choice.</p>
                <p>When making your decision, you should bear several considerations in mind, like the difficulty level
                    you’re willing to tackle, the programming language knowledge you already possess that meshes with
                    your existing coding skills, or your reasons for learning a top programming language. </p>
                <p>Whether you want to develop a mobile application, get certification for programming knowledge, or
                    learn new skills, you need to learn the right programming language. Below you’ll learn about the
                    best programming languages in demand among employers in 2023. You’ll be briefed about the details of
                    each language, its complexity, and how it is used.</p>
                <p>A programming language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers.
                    Programming languages consist of a set of rules that allows string values to be converted into
                    various ways of generating machine code, or, in the case of visual programming languages, graphical
                    elements.
                </p>
                <p>Generally speaking, a program is a set of instructions written in a particular language (C, C++,
                    Java, Python) to achieve a particular task.
                </p>
                <p>What coding and programming language should i learn? JavaScript and Python, two of the most popular
                    languages in the startup industry, are in high demand. Most startups use Python-based backend
                    frameworks such as Django (Python), Flask (Python), and NodeJS (JavaScript). These languages are
                    also considered to be the best programming languages to learn for beginners.
                </p>
                <p>Below is a list of the most popular and best programming languages that will be in demand in 2023.

                <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
                    Wide Web. It is used as a client-side programming language by 97.8 percent of all websites.
                    JavaScript was originally used only to develop web browsers, but they are now used for server-side
                    website deployments and non-web browser applications as well. </p>
                <p>Javascript was created in 1995 and was initially known as LiveScript. However, Java was a very
                    popular language at that time, so it was advertised as a “younger brother” of Java. As it evolved
                    over time, JavaScript became a fully independent language. Nowadays, JavaScript is often confused
                    with Java, and although there are some similarities between them, the two languages are distinct.

                <p>Go was developed by Google in 2007 for APIs and web applications. Go has recently become one of the
                    fastest-growing programming languages due to its simplicity, as well as its ability to handle
                    multicore and networked systems and massive codebases. </p>
                <p>Go, also known as Golang, was created to meet the needs of programmers working on large projects. It
                    has gained popularity among many large IT companies thanks to its simple and modern structure and
                    syntax familiarity. Companies using Go as their programming language include Google, Uber, Twitch,
                    Dropbox, among many others. Go is also gaining in popularity among data scientists because of its
                    agility and performance.

                <p>Java is one of the most popular programming languages used today.  Owned by Oracle Corporation, this general-purpose programming language with its object-oriented structure has become a standard for applications that can be used regardless of platform (e.g., Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.) because of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities. As a result, Java is recognized for its portability across platforms, from mainframe data centers to smartphones. Today there are more than 3 billion devices running applications built with Java.</p>
                <p>Java is widely used in web and application development as well as big data. Java is also used on the backend of several popular websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube. It is also extensively used in hundreds of applications. New Java frameworks like Spring, Struts, and Hibernate are also very popular. With millions of Java developers worldwide, there are hundreds of ways to learn Java. Also, Java programmers have an extensive online community and support each other to solve problems.
